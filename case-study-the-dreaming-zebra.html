      <h2 class="heading-2">Discover</h2>
      <div class="project-description">In order to understand what the UX/UI issues were on The Dreaming Zebra Foundation&#x27;s website, we began by performing a heuristic evaluation of their website. This evaluation helped us determine specific areas of improvement that could be addressed in a redesign. We found that The Dreaming Zebra Foundation website&#x27;s current design was very heavy on text and images, and lacked a clear information hierarchy that would guide users to the information that is most important to them. We also found that the forms on the website were too long and would likely discourage users from filling them out.<br><br>We also wanted to better understand the user journeys of someone who contributes to The Dreaming Zebra Foundation, as well as someone who benefits from it. Due to the pandemic limiting The Dreaming Zebra Foundation&#x27;s philanthropic activities, finding users with direct experience with the foundation was difficult and we instead based our user research on surveys and interviews with users who potentially could either contribute or benefit from The Dreaming Zebra Foundation. For our user interviews, we also focused on interviewing teachers who were interested in both contributing to and benefiting from The Dreaming Zebra Foundation.<br></div><img src="images/annotations2.png" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 92vw, (max-width: 767px) 95vw, (max-width: 991px) 546px, 705px" srcset="images/annotations2-p-500.png 500w, images/annotations2-p-800.png 800w, images/annotations2-p-1080.png 1080w, images/annotations2.png 1394w" alt="" class="image border seventy-five-image">

      <h2 class="project-heading-2">Research Results</h2>
      <div class="project-description">Through our user research, we found that most people prefer to interact with non-profit organizations either completely through the website, or in-person after getting information from the website. The teachers we interviewed preferred an application process for benefiting from a non-profit organization that was completely digital, as they disliked their experiences filling out paper forms when working for their school districts. They also expressed a preference for shorter, easier to fill out digital forms, as their busy schedules as teachers left little free time.<br><br>For survey respondents who had experience contributing to non-profit organizations, over 80% of them responded that they preferred contributing to non-profit organizations by making monetary donations, rather than donating their time.<br></div>
