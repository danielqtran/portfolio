        <h2 class="project-heading-2">Brief</h2>
        <div class="project-description"><strong>Christa McAuliffe Academy School of Arts and Sciences (CMASAS) is an online K-12 private school focused on educating children all around the world at their own pace.</strong> As an online only school, CMASAS&#x27;s website is the first place prospective students and their families learn about the program, and serves as an information hub for current students and their families. However, the website was over 5 years old and was in need of a redesign. <strong>With the increased interest in at-home education due to the pandemic, our enrollment counselors and customer service representatives reported that they were being overwhelmed with helping answer users&#x27; questions and paying their tuition. </strong>A project was started to both redesign the website and improve the tuition payment process.</div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2 class="project-heading-2">My Role and Responsibilities</h2>
        <div class="project-description">My role was the UX Designer and I was responsible for leading the design process for the website redesign, as well as the implementation. I worked alongside the Director of Marketing for much of the <em>User Research</em> and <em>Define</em> portions of the redesign process.</div>

      <div class="highlight yellow">
        <div class="project-description"><strong>Specifically, we wanted to know:</strong><br></div>

      <h2 class="project-heading-2">Competitor Analysis</h2>
      <div class="project-description">Our next step was looking into our competitors to understand the market of online K-12 schooling. We researched both private online schools as well as public ones by exploring their websites, signing up for marketing emails, and calling enrollment counselors to be led through their enrollment processes. We found that in nearly all cases, private schools&#x27; websites led the customer journey to end outside of the website by talking to an enrollment counselor on the phone. Takeaways of well-designed school websites were ones that showcased example successful students and how the school is the right fit for them, included an example course and course schedules, and provided a catalog of all classes offered.</div>

      <h2 class="project-heading-2">Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
      <div class="project-description">The Director of Marketing and I then completed a heuristic evaluation of the entire site in order to identify existing pain points and to generate low-effort solutions. We found numerous legibility issues such as low contrast on text that did not meet accessibility standards, and small font sizes that made it difficult to read on mobile devices. We also noted content that we wanted to keep in the redesign as well.</div>

      <div class="project-description">After performing research and gathering insights from users about the process of finding an online school, the next step was to define some goals for the redesign. First, we wanted to create a persona in order to best represent our users goals, needs, and frustrations. Then we would use the persona to map out our users&#x27; current journey to understand the enrollment process. Finally, we wanted to map out our website content and perform a card sorting exercise to better structure the website and make it more intuitive for users to meet their needs.</div>

      <h2 class="project-heading-2">Persona</h2>
      <div class="project-description">Using data from our research interviews, we created a persona to represent a typical customer. This persona will be used to keep customers&#x27; needs and frustrations into account when redesigning the website, as well as use it to guide our design process through the customer journey. The persona we designed is an accounts manager in her 40s with two high school-aged children looking for an online school that fits their individual needs.</div>

      <div class="project-description">I also researched the user journey by going through the entire process of being a customer and recording all the pages interacted with and steps taken. I began by researching tuition plans from the viewpoint of the persona we had created and then interacting with the website in order to select a tuition plan. Once I had completed all the research, I selected a tuition plan, set up a payment plan for it, and then enrolled a student. I also followed the journey of managing a tuition plan. From our user research and competitor analysis, we knew that having a system for users to be able to see what their tuition plan was and make changes to it without having to talk to school staff was important.</div>

      <h2 class="project-heading-2">Information Architecture</h2>
      <div class="project-description">Our research also showed that users often were frustrated when navigating school websites as they found their menus unintuitive and information about the school&#x27;s tuition, academic support, and extracurricular activities hard to find. Thus, we wanted to design an information architecture for the website redesign that would make it simple and intuitive for users to find the information they need, whether that was curriculum or counseling. We first completed an extensive site map of our website, and then looked at competitors&#x27; sites to see how they laid out their websites. Particular attention was paid to how other schools presented their curriculum and application process. Using our own site along with notes gathered from our competitors&#x27; sites, we developed a list of common categories online school pages are categorized into.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container w-container">
      <h2 class="project-heading-2">Card Sorting</h2>
      <div class="project-description">In order to better understand how users might intuitively categorize web pages, we performed a card sorting exercise with over 20 participants consisting of school staff, parents, and students. The results were insightful as we found even users who were already familiar with our site preferred several pages organized into different categories than the ones they are currently in.</div>

    <div class="w-layout-blockcontainer container w-container">
      <h2 class="project-heading-2">Site Map</h2>

      <h2 class="project-heading-2">Ecommerce design</h2>
      <div class="project-description">The company wanted to prioritize redesigning their e-commerce system before redesigning the rest of the website. Currently, the company&#x27;s website only had the ability to take credit card payments - other methods of payment had to be done through contacting our accounts manager via phone or email. Managing tuition after the initial payment also had to be done through the accounts manager as there was no customer dashboard where a customer could view which tuition they were enrolled in and how they were paid for.<br><br>The two main requirements for the ecommerce platform were for it to integrate with our existing Customer Management System (CMS) and payment gateway. We researched several e-commerce platforms and tested Shopify for a few weeks before settling on WooCommerce, an e-commerce platform plugin for WordPress. We selected WooCommerce provided us with flexibility to integrate with our payment gateway and accounting platform through various affordable plugins.<br><br>Using Elementor, a website builder for WordPress, I developed a store for customers to pay for tuition, purchase individual courses, and buy merchandise. I also incorporated feedback from customers and updated the design to make it easier for users to fill out fields, find required fees, track their progress in the checkout process, and view their tuition plans and upcoming payments.</div>
