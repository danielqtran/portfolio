                            provide donations of art supplies or musical instruments for underprivileged children to

                            Foundation's website, we began by performing a heuristic evaluation of their website. This
                            evaluation helped us determine specific areas of improvement that could be addressed in a
                            redesign. We found that The Dreaming Zebra Foundation website's current design was very
                            heavy on text and images, and lacked a clear information hierarchy that would guide users to
                            the information that is most important to them. We also found that the forms on the website
                            were too long and would likely discourage users from filling them out.
                        </p>
                        <p>We also wanted to better understand the user journeys of someone who contributes to The
                            Dreaming Zebra Foundation, as well as someone who benefits from it. Due to the pandemic
                            limiting The Dreaming Zebra Foundation's philanthropic activities, finding users with direct
                            experience with the foundation was difficult and we instead based our user research on
                            surveys and interviews with users who potentially could either contribute or benefit from
                            The Dreaming Zebra Foundation. For our user interviews, we also focused on interviewing
                            teachers who were interested in both contributing to and benefiting from The Dreaming Zebra
                            Foundation.

                                getting information from the website. The teachers we interviewed preferred an

                                process for benefiting from a non-profit organization that was completely digital, as

                                They also expressed a preference for shorter, easier to fill out digital forms, as their
                                busy schedules as teachers left little free time.
